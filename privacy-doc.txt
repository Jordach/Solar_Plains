Welcome to this Minetest 0.5-dev server, running Solar Plains.

This server is operated by <YOU>, which can be reached at:

EMAIL@EMAIL.COM

If you wish to read this formspec again, use the command: /privacy

Here's what I'll store temporarily until server closing, or server reset:

IP Address - this is stored as part of the ban system. Please be aware using multiple accounts from the same location will ban all of them.

IP adresses and usernames are only linked when a ban command is ran.

Username - used to identify you ingame, and can be renamed to your choice or deleted along with any data, except changes to the world. Changes to the world are considered non private information.

Custom Appearances - if requested, I can give you a copy of the skin, remove it, or simply replace it with another one of your choosing.

Email Address - used explicitly to recover your in game username in case you ever forget your password or username.

Please be aware that using an email for username recovery is entirely optional and not required to use this service.

The email address will be hashed by SHA256 and salted by your password's hash.

Downloading your data will contain the world file and only contain the server world (of export time) and your player file with it's current password. The encrypted password can be removed by request.

Chat - is potentially logged by other clients, but not the server. It is considered to be non private information.

Private messages - can be sent to other users are considered private and are not logged whatsoever, unless, like the above, the other user is logging it.

If you agree to this - click the agree button.

If you do not agree to the above terms - press the disagree button and the server will gently disconnect you until you reconnect and decide otherwise.
