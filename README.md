# Code Styling:

Use tabs - any editor can configure a single tab into X amount of spaces.

Keep it simple and modular - if it stops working in one version but works in another; it's entirely replaceable.

If you're struggling with that, write the logic flow into smaller steps on paper first; you'll see how much of a difference it makes.

Use each mod's namespace for functions; you may never know when another item implements something similar.

Try and reuse code whenever possible. Beds is an example that shows that this is possible.
