1 Water Bucket = 1m^3 = 1000L

10L = 1 WP

1 WP = 2 ME (Small Water Wheel)
? WP = 10 ME (Thrust Piston)
     = 20 ME (Windmill)
Pipes should carry 10L per straight Pipe;

Small (1m^3 size) Water wheel produces 2 ME per 10L of water.

Non-ME machines require a standard pipe connected from the top. These have small water wheels inside them to produce ME.

ME machines require more torque (and pressure?) than what a water pipe can normally provide.

-- Machines:

Ore Grinder; Turns ores into powdery lumps, low tier uses Water Pressure (produces , high tier uses Mechanical Energy
 * Consumes 1 WP, 20 ME
 * Processing Time: WP = 10 seconds; ME = 3 seconds.
 
Grinder; Multipurpose grinder, uses Water Pressure and ME for the higher tier. On April fools both Ore Grinder and Grinder become Grindr.
 * Comsumes 1 WP, 20 ME
 * Processing Time: WP = 8 seconds; ME = 3 seconds.

Compacter: Wanna turn that excess biomatter into burnable briquettes? Uses ME.

Hydrualic Press: Uses ME only. Useful for both destroying unwanted items and making pressed metal.

Sprinkler Head: Uses WP only. Turns existing water supply into a source for farmland.
